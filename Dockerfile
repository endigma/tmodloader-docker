# deleting the first line of the manage-tModLoaderServer.sh script
# this is because that first line will download the newest version of tModLoader, which we've already installed above.
# note : it's better to install tModLoader at build time rather than execution time to avoid breaking older versions of the container, as well as speeding up execution. hence this cheap workaround. This might break if the script is heavily modified.
